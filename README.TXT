# Installation

You'll need to have ffmpeg installed + everything at requirements.txt in order to run the Whisper models.
If you want to run CUDA, install that too and make sure your torch is compiled with it enabled.

test-whisper.py should test the model on a single file, benchmark.py runs the whole dataset
